This is a Bitcoin signature vulnerability analysis tool designed for cybersecurity education. The application allows users to enter Bitcoin addresses, fetch unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), decode raw Bitcoin transactions, and analyze ECDSA signatures for potential vulnerabilities like nonce reuse. The tool demonstrates how cryptographic weaknesses in Bitcoin signatures can lead to private key recovery in a controlled educational environment.
