A vulnerability known as Signature Malleability poses a serious threat to Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies that use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate signatures, creating invalid but acceptable signatures for the system. This article discusses the mechanisms of exploitation of this vulnerability, its implications for the security of cryptocurrencies, and proposed measures to mitigate it. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is an algorithm that is widely used to create digital signatures for a BTC or ETH coin transfer transaction in Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies. The signature consists of two components:  _**r**_  and  _**s**_ , which depend on a random nonce  _**k**_  (NONCE) and a private key _**x**_  (PrivKey) of the signatory.

## How does Signature Malleability vulnerability occur in Bitcoin transaction?

[Permalink: How does Signature Malleability vulnerability occur in Bitcoin transaction?](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#how-does-signature-malleability-vulnerability-occur-in-bitcoin-transaction)

**Signature Malleability** vulnerabilities  arise because it is possible to change the value  _**s**_  in a signature while maintaining the validity of the signature. This is possible because multiple equivalent values  **​​( _r_ , _s_ ′)** can be obtained for the same signature :

[![Research into Signature Malleability and Private Key Compromise in Bitcoin Signatures](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/raw/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/image-1.png)](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/blob/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/image-1.png)

(where  _**n**_  is the order of the elliptic curve group _**secp256k1**_ ). In this way, an attacker can create a new signature that will be accepted as valid by the system. **Insufficient value checking** : If the values ​​of  _**r**_  and  _**s**_  are not checked for valid ranges (e.g., must be between **1** and  _**n**_ **−1** ), this may allow attackers to use incorrect values ​​to create fake signatures.

CVE-2024-42461 is a vulnerability found in the Elliptic library used to implement the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in Node.js. This vulnerability is related to **the Ricci Flow** **Hidden Number Problem _(Ricci Flow HNP)_** , which makes it particularly important for the security of cryptographic applications. **The Hidden Number Problem** is a mathematical problem that consists of finding a hidden number used in the encryption process. In the context of ECDSA, if an attacker can solve the HNP, this can lead to the compromise of private keys. CVE-2024-42461 allows a potential attacker to extract information about private keys from signatures, which compromises the integrity of digital signatures and user authentication. This vulnerability opens up a wide range of attacks, as the vulnerability can be used in various attacks, including authentication and data integrity attacks. This could cause serious problems for systems that rely on ECDSA to secure Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrency transactions.

## **[Ricci Flow HNP](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/blob/main/36SignatureMalleability/Ricci_Flow_Hidden_Number_Problem.txt)**

[Permalink: Ricci Flow HNP](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#ricci-flow-hnp)

**The Ricci Flow Hidden Number Problem (HNP** _)_ has become a key tool in proving theorems such as [the Thurston elliptization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_elliptization_conjecture) ,  [Geometrization conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture) , and  [Poincaré conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture) , which concern the topology of manifolds. Hamilton and later [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) used this approach to obtain deep results about the structure of manifolds, which can mean using flow to identify and analyze hidden geometric features of manifolds, allowing one to infer their topology and other properties.

> _The Ricci flow is closely related to curvature theory, since it uses the Ricci tensor to describe changes in the Riemannian metric on a manifold._

## Basic Relationships Between Ricci Flow and Curvature

[Permalink: Basic Relationships Between Ricci Flow and Curvature](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#basic-relationships-between-ricci-flow-and-curvature)

- **Ricci Tensor:** The Ricci flow is based on the Ricci tensor, which is the average of sectional curvatures. It reflects how the shape of a manifold changes with its curvature, where it is formulated as the problem of finding a hidden number when the results of a function applied to combinations of that number with known elements are known. This can be useful in the context of cryptography, especially in public-key systems where it is important to minimize leakage of information about private keys.
- **Curvature dynamics:** During the Ricci flow, the metric changes in such a way that the curvature can increase or decrease. This allows us to analyze how the geometric properties of the manifold affect its topology.
- **Singularities:** The Ricci flow can lead to singularities, points where the curvature becomes infinite. Studying these singularities is key to understanding the long-term behavior of the flow and its application to topological problems such as the Poincaré conjecture.
- **Maximum principle:** The Ricci flow preserves the positivity of the scalar curvature, which allows us to use maximum principles to analyze the geometric properties of manifolds under deformation.

> _This quadratic equation may have one or two roots — asymptotic directions, or no roots. The presence of a root provides an ordinary differential equation of the first order, the indication of a point on the surface sets the initial conditions for its solution. The theorem of the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the Cauchy problem for an ordinary differential equation of the first order, proved in courses on mathematical analysis, leads to the following geometric result. On a surface consisting of elliptical points, there are no real asymptotic lines; on a surface consisting of hyperbolic points, there is an asymptotic network; on a surface consisting of parabolic points that are not flattening points, a unique asymptotic line passes through each point._

## **Optimization of algorithms**

[Permalink: Optimization of algorithms](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#optimization-of-algorithms)

The methods developed in the framework of Ricci flow theory can be adapted to optimize computations in elliptic curve cryptography, especially in the context of operations on points on elliptic curves secp256k1. Thus, the Ricci flow not only serves as a tool for studying the evolution of metrics, but also provides a deep connection between geometry and topology through curvature analysis. Take for example the numbers **“N”** and **“P”** which are important parameters in the context of elliptic curve cryptography, especially in the secp256k1 standard, which is widely used in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain and cryptocurrency.

### The meaning of the number N

[Permalink: The meaning of the number N](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#the-meaning-of-the-number-n)

**N** is the order of the group of points on the elliptic curve. It determines the maximum number of points that can be used to generate keys in cryptographic algorithms. In the case of **secp256k1** , the value of **N** is:

```
N = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03bbfd25e8cd0364141
```

> _This number also indicates that when working with this curve, all operations must be performed within this order._

* * *

### The meaning of the number P

[Permalink: The meaning of the number P](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#the-meaning-of-the-number-p)

**P** is a characteristic of the elliptic curve itself, a prime number that defines the field in which the work on the points on the curve occurs. The value of **P** for **secp256k1** is:

```
P = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2f
```

> _This number specifies the size of the field, which is important for determining the range of possible values ​​of the coordinates of points on the curve._

* * *

## Difference between N and P

[Permalink: Difference between N and P](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#difference-between-n-and-p)

- **Group Order (N)** : Determines the number of points on the curve that can be used for cryptographic operations.
- **Prime Number (P)** : Defines the field in which the curve operates. This number is important for mathematical operations on points on the curve.

Thus, although both numbers play a key role in ensuring the security and functionality of cryptographic systems, they perform different functions: **N** concerns _the structure of a group of points_ , and **P** concerns _the structure of a field_ .

## How to exploit Signature Malleability in Bitcoin transaction?

[Permalink: How to exploit Signature Malleability in Bitcoin transaction?](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#how-to-exploit-signature-malleability-in-bitcoin-transaction)

To implement a full-fledged attack on Bitcoin using the **Signature Malleability** vulnerability, it is necessary to change the equivalent value  **( _s_ ′)** as shown in the second column of the table of components _of the value **(R, S, Z)**_ _of the digital signature in **ECDSA**_ .

[![Research into Signature Malleability and Private Key Compromise in Bitcoin Signatures](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/raw/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/nonces-1024x412.png)](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/blob/main/36SignatureMalleability/Ricci_Flow_Hidden_Number_Problem.txt)[**36SignatureMalleability/Ricci\_Flow\_Hidden\_Number\_Problem.txt**](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/blob/main/36SignatureMalleability/Ricci_Flow_Hidden_Number_Problem.txt)

```
P = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2f
```

For a successful attack on Bitcoin, _**32**_ **ECDSA** signature transactions are enough , where by changing the two initial digits **of HEX** to the equivalent value  **( _s_ ′)** we build a table to determine the range of possible values ​​of the coordinates of points on the curve, as well as optimizing the mathematical algorithms developed within the framework of the Ricci flow theory. Since Ricci flows are closely related to the curvature theory, we can use the average value of the sectional curvature and solve the hidden number problem, where by applying the obtained data to _**32**_ Bitcoin transactions we extract from the given values _**​​​​(R, S, Z)**_ the initial data for _the secret keys_ : **( _k_ ′)** NONCE for _**32**_ Bitcoin transactions and using the **Ricci Flow HNP** _(Ricci Flow Hidden Number Problem)_ tool  we find the hidden number: **( _x_ ′)** PrivKey – _private key_ .

### The R and S values ​​are the main components of a digital signature in ECDSA

[Permalink: The R and S values ​​are the main components of a digital signature in ECDSA](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#the-r-and-s-values-are-the-main-components-of-a-digital-signature-in-ecdsa)

> _**The R** value is the coordinate of a point on the elliptic curve that results from mathematical operations involving a private key and a random number (called a “cryptographic random number”). This value ensures that the signature is unique for each message, even if it is signed with the same private key._

* * *

> _The value of  **S**  is calculated based on the message digest (hash function) and the private key. It is related to how well the signature verifies the authenticity of the message. The value of  **S**  also depends on the value of **R** and the random number._

* * *

### How R and S are formed _(signature verification method)_

[Permalink: How R and S are formed (signature verification method)](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#how-r-and-s-are-formedsignature-verification-method)

The process of generating R and S values ​​involves the following steps:

1. **Generating a message digest** : First, a hash of the message is created using an algorithm such as SHA-256.
2. **Random Number Selection** : A random number is generated and used to create a point on the elliptic curve.
3. **Calculating R** : Using this random number, the coordinate of a point on the curve is calculated, which becomes the R value.
4. **Calculation of S** : The value of S is calculated given the message digest and the private key.

When verifying a signature, the recipient uses the R and S values ​​along with the sender’s public key and the message digest to verify the authenticity of the signature. If all calculations match, this means that the message was indeed signed by the owner of the corresponding private key.

### **How to get R, S, Z** value from **RawTX** _(Signature Decoding Method)_

[Permalink: How to get R, S, Z value from RawTX (Signature Decoding Method)](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#how-to-get-r-s-zvaluefromrawtxsignature-decoding-method)

> _**RawTX** is an encoded representation of a Bitcoin transaction in hexadecimal format. It contains all the data needed to complete a Bitcoin transaction._

### Extract **R, S, Z:**

[Permalink: Extract R, S, Z:](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#extractr-s-z)

- A signature in ECDSA consists of two components: **R** and **S** . After decoding **RawTX,** find the field containing the signature _(usually part of the transaction input)._
- The signature will be represented as _a_ **DER** encoding . You will need to extract the **R** and **S** values ​​from this signature. They are usually represented as two integers, which can be extracted using _**[deserialization](https://cryptodeeptech.ru/deserialize-signature-vulnerability-bitcoin/)**_ .
- **The Z** value is a hash of the message being signed. To get Z, you have to hash the transaction data _(usually using SHA-256)_ that was signed.

> _[General solution of a differential equation](https://keyhunters.ru/differential-equations/) where the function  **y**  depends on the variable  **x** ._

1. **Original equation** :

   - The left side of the equation can be interpreted as the derivative of the function  _**y**_  with respect to  _**x**_ , which is equal to the product of two functions:  **_g_ ( _y_ )** , depending on  _**y**_ , and  **_h_ ( _x_ )** , depending on  _**x**_ .
2. **Rewriting the equation** :

   - The equation can be rewritten in a form that separates the variables:

[![Research into Signature Malleability and Private Key Compromise in Bitcoin Signatures](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/raw/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/image-22.png)](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/blob/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/image-22.png) This allows both sides to be integrated separately.

After separating the variables, we can integrate both sides exactly:

_Left side relative to  **y**_ :

> _Using [**Perelman Work**](https://perelmanwork.com/) and [**Dockeyhunt**](https://dockeyhunt.com/dockeyhunt-lattice-attack/) [**Lattice Attack, we arbitrarily change variables to**](https://dockeyhunt.com/dockeyhunt-lattice-attack/) [**Signature Malleability**](https://cryptodeeptech.ru/signature-malleability/) vulnerability as we wrote at the beginning [of the article](https://cryptodeeptech.ru/signature-malleability/) this vulnerability in Bitcoin transaction occurs due to the fact that it is possible to change the value of  **S**  in the signature, while maintaining the validity of the signature. As we reported in the arbitrary formula all this is possible due to the fact that for the same signature it is possible to obtain several equivalent values  **​​(r,s′)** :_

[![Research into Signature Malleability and Private Key Compromise in Bitcoin Signatures](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/raw/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/image-37.png)](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability/blob/main/Research%20into%20Signature%20Malleability%20and%20Private%20Key%20Compromise%20in%20Bitcoin%20Signatures%20-%20CRYPTO%20DEEP%20TECH_files/image-37.png)

* * *

As a final result of the transformation of variables in the signature value **R, S′, Z** we see two digits the value **_S_ ′** is built as **a field structure (P)** :

```
P = 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffefffffc2f
```

This number defines the field in which the **secp256k1** curve operates to perform mathematical operations on points on _an elliptic curve_ .

Now we know the signatures of the difference between the numbers **N** and **P** . When reducing, we can get a hidden number **X** as we know when shifting the generation of one-time numbers **(NONCES)** , the value of the signature variables **R, S′, Z** will tend to one point. This point will be a hidden number, that is, _**a private key**_ .

( **N**  are  _point group structures_ ,  **P**  are  _field structures_ , **X**  is  _a private key_ )

## Conclusion\
\
[Permalink: Conclusion](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#conclusion)\
\
There are many methods to detect and prevent counterfeit signatures in the Bitcoin network. These methods range from simple solutions such as increasing the number of confirmations to more complex anomaly analysis systems and regular security protocol updates. Effective protection requires a comprehensive approach to network security and constant monitoring of new threats. Counterfeit signatures can lead to fraudulent transactions and loss of funds. The main methods used to detect and prevent such attacks are:\
\
> ### 1\. Increasing the number of confirmations\
>\
> [Permalink: 1. Increasing the number of confirmations](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#1-increasing-the-number-of-confirmations)\
>\
> One of the simplest ways to protect against counterfeit signatures is to increase the number of confirmations of a transaction before it is finally accepted. It is recommended to wait for at least six confirmations to reduce the likelihood of a successful attack. This ensures that the transaction was included in the block and cannot be reversed.\
>\
> ### 2\. Analysis of blocks and transactions\
>\
> [Permalink: 2. Analysis of blocks and transactions](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#2-analysis-of-blocks-and-transactions)\
>\
> Mining software and network nodes analyze blocks and transactions for conflicts and anomalies. This includes checking the signature for compliance with the format, as well as checking the values ​​of  _**r**_  and  _**s**_  for acceptable ranges. If the values ​​are outside the acceptable ranges, the transaction may be rejected.\
>\
> ### 3\. Implementation of anomaly analysis systems\
>\
> [Permalink: 3. Implementation of anomaly analysis systems](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#3-implementation-of-anomaly-analysis-systems)\
>\
> Using anomaly analysis systems can identify suspicious transactions and blockchains. These systems can use machine learning algorithms to detect unusual behavior in the network, which may indicate attempts to forge signatures.\
>\
> ### 4\. Network monitoring software\
>\
> [Permalink: 4. Network monitoring software](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#4-network-monitoring-software)\
>\
> Tools such as [Wireshark](https://keyhunters.ru/sybil-and-eclipse-attacks/) can be used to analyze network traffic and identify suspicious activity. Monitoring network traffic can help identify [Sybil](https://keyhunters.ru/sybil-and-eclipse-attacks/) or [Eclipse](https://keyhunters.ru/sybil-and-eclipse-attacks/) attacks that can be used to manipulate transactions.\
>\
> ### 5\. Regularly update security protocols\
>\
> [Permalink: 5. Regularly update security protocols](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#5-regularly-update-security-protocols)\
>\
> Regularly updating software and security protocols helps to eliminate known vulnerabilities, such as the [**DeserializeSignature**](https://cryptodeeptech.ru/deserialize-signature-vulnerability-bitcoin/) vulnerability , which allows attackers to create invalid signatures. Updates should include fixes for all known vulnerabilities and security improvements.\
>\
> ### 6\. Multi-level confirmation\
>\
> [Permalink: 6. Multi-level confirmation](https://github.com/demining/Signature-Malleability#6-multi-level-confirmation)\
>\
> Using multiple levels of transaction confirmation can improve network security. This could include additional checks by nodes or using third-party services to verify signatures.\
