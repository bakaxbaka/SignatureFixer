# Overview

This is a Bitcoin signature vulnerability analysis tool designed for cybersecurity education. The application allows users to enter Bitcoin addresses, fetch unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), decode raw transactions, and demonstrate signature vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. The tool simulates vulnerabilities like DeserializeSignature flaws and SIGHASH_SINGLE bugs to help students and professionals understand Bitcoin security weaknesses without any risk to real funds.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool. It follows a component-based architecture with:

- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React hooks with TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

The application uses a dark theme by default and includes educational warnings to emphasize the tool's purpose as a learning resource.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js server with TypeScript that provides REST API endpoints for:

- **UTXO Fetching**: Retrieves unspent transaction outputs from Bitcoin addresses
- **Transaction Decoding**: Parses raw Bitcoin transactions and extracts signature components
- **Vulnerability Testing**: Simulates signature vulnerabilities for educational purposes

The server uses a service-oriented architecture with separate modules for Bitcoin operations and signature analysis.

## Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a dual storage approach:

- **Development**: In-memory storage with a simple Map-based implementation
- **Production**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database Schema**: Single table for analysis results with JSONB fields for flexible data storage

## Authentication and Authorization
Currently, the application does not implement user authentication, operating as a single-user educational tool. Session management is handled through connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage when needed.

## API Design
The REST API follows standard HTTP conventions with three main endpoints:

- `POST /api/utxos` - Fetches UTXOs for a given Bitcoin address
- `POST /api/decode-transaction` - Decodes raw transaction hex data
- `POST /api/vulnerability-test` - Runs vulnerability simulations

All endpoints return JSON responses with consistent error handling and validation using Zod schemas.

# External Dependencies

## Third-party Services
- **BlockCypher API**: Primary service for fetching Bitcoin UTXO data and transaction information
- **Blockstream API**: Fallback service for Bitcoin blockchain data when BlockCypher is unavailable

## Databases
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database using Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with schema management

## Key Libraries
- **Bitcoin Operations**: Custom Bitcoin utilities for address validation and transaction parsing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking and schema validation
- **HTTP Client**: Native fetch API with TanStack Query for caching and state management

## Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the full stack
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: JavaScript bundler for production builds

The application is designed to work in both development and production environments with proper fallback mechanisms for external API failures.
